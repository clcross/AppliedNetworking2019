        <tr>
            <td>1. This lab was very tough and i felt that there was not enough explained and that the lab was assigned
                without enough time to complete it. This lab was assigned at the end of a testing week and asks for us
                to complete tasks not yet learned.</td>

        <tr>
            <td><br />
                2. This lab Require 2 routers/switches, 2 computer, and 3 to 4 ethernet cables made by my partner
                and I. This lab was done in my room on campus over the course of 4 days.

        <tr>
            <td><br />
                3. Section II deals with creating the ethernet cables which in my opinion was the easiest part of this
                entire lab.<br />
                Section III deals with installing and setting up Samba servers on our laptops and then making a LAN with
                one of the routers/swithes. This wasn't that bad but it was pretty easy too. The hardest part of this
                section was learning how to use the server to send something to my partner. this is something that
                should have for sure been taught in class.<br />
                Section IV was about making the LAN work with 2 routers/switches. This was probably the hardest part of
                the lab, while we figured out how to do it with 1 it was too difficult for us to do it with 2. when the
                2 routers/switches were connected they did not allow us to see eachothers servers and we could not make
                them work with any orentation.
